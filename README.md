WHO estimates that at least 20% of young people suffer from mental illnesses such as depression, mood disorders, substance abuse, suicidal behaviour, or eating disorders. One-fifth of India's population (aged 15-24 years) is comprised of youth and only 7.3% of this 365 million youth report such problems. These two statistics indicate that there is a large population of young people in India who may be at risk or suffering from mental disorders, which may result in significant morbidity and mortality. The public stigma associated with mental health problems mainly affects help-seeking among young people. One-third of young people display poor knowledge of mental health problems and negative attitudes towards people with mental health problems and one in five had actual/intended stigmatising behaviour. Young people cannot recognize the causes and symptoms of mental health problems and believe that recovery is unlikely. People with mental health problems are perceived as dangerous and irresponsible, likely due to misinformation and misunderstanding of mental health problems. In developed countries, consulting a therapist is normal, but in India, there is still a stigma associated with it. Over the next decade, India will be the world's workhorse. So it's important to have a mentally sound youth.

To reduce stigmas associated with mental health issues among youth, we are developing a service provider web platform that targets teenagers who have difficulty seeking mental health help. We will encourage users to seek help when they visit our website. We want to provide users with the necessary help while maintaining their anonymity. Their needs will be met through the aid of an AI-based bot. In addition, they will be introduced to a community of people dealing with similar issues, people who have recovered and therapists, As a result, we will be able to normalise these issues in the future. The lack of acceptance of mental health issues as a symptom of a disease is widespread in our society.
The goal of our product is to break the taboo by empowering the client to diagnose, treat and be open about their illness. To achieve this, we have developed an AI model that converse warmly with our clients.
