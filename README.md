# Saga Foundation
A service provider platform that targets teenagers who have difficulty seeking mental health help. The Taboos surrounding mental health are often ignored and unaddressed. A lack of acceptance of mental health issues as a symptom of a disease is widespread in our society.
The goal of our product is to break the taboo by empowering the client to diagnose, treat and be open about their illness. To achieve this, we have developed an AI model that converse warmly with our clients.
